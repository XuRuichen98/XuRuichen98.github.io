### ### Hi! Welcome to my webpage!

### 欢迎来到我的主页！

I am Ruichen XU, a PhD student in Pure Mathematics at the *Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences*, under the guidance of Professor Xin WAN.

**Contact**: xuruichen21@mails.ucas.ac.cn

### Education

- **2023.9 – (Expected 2026.7)**: PhD Student in Pure Mathematics, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Supervisor: Professor Xin WAN.  
- **2021.9 – 2023.7**: Master’s Student in Pure Mathematics, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Supervisor: Professor Xin WAN.

### Research Interests

I am interested in *Iwasawa theory*, a branch of number theory, and my current research focuses on the following topics:

- Automorphic methods in Iwasawa theory
- Construction of Euler systems
- Iwasawa theory in (Hida, Coleman or universal) families
- Arithmetic applications of Iwasawa theory: Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, and its generalization to the Bloch-Kato conjecture, etc.

### Publications and Pre-publications
