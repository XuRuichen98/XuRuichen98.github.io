### 欢迎来到我的主页！

I am Ruichen XU, a PhD student in Pure Mathematics at the *Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences*, under the guidance of Professor Xin WAN.

**Contact**: xuruichen21[at]mails.ucas.ac.cn

### Education

- **2023.9 – (Expected 2026.7)**: PhD Student in Pure Mathematics, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Supervisor: Professor Xin WAN.  
- **2021.9 – 2023.7**: Master’s Student in Pure Mathematics, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Supervisor: Professor Xin WAN.

  - Participated in the "Enhanced Program for Graduate Study" organized by the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research and Peking University during the Spring semesters of 2020 (online) and 2021.  

### Research Interests

I am interested in *Iwasawa theory*, a branch of number theory, and my current research focuses on the following topics:

- Automorphic methods in Iwasawa theory  
- Iwasawa theory in families  
- Arithmetic applications of Iwasawa theory, such as the arithmetic of elliptic curves in relation to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, and its extensions to Galois representations, including the Bloch-Kato conjecture  

### Publications and Pre-publications
