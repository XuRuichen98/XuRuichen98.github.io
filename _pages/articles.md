- **On the Mordell-Weil rank of certain CM abelian varieties over anticyclotomic towers**, with *Haidong LI*, preprint (2025). [arXiv:2502.12648](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12648).
Let \(K/\mathbb{Q}\) be an imaginary quadratic extension, and let \(p\) be an odd prime. In this paper, we investigate the growth of Mordell-Weil ranks of CM abelian varieties associated with Hecke characters over \(K\) of infinite type \((1,0)\) along the \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-anticyclotomic tower of \(K\). Our results cover all decomposition types of \(p\) in \(K\).
The analytic aspect of our proof is based on our computations of the local and global root numbers of Hecke characters, together with a recent generalization by H. Jia of D. Rohrlichâ€™s result concerning the relation between the vanishing orders of Hecke \(L\)-functions and their root numbers. The arithmetic conclusions then follow from the Gross-Zagier formula and the Kolyvagin machinery.

- **The Gan-Gross-Prasad period of Klingen Eisenstein families over unitary groups**, preprint (2024). [arXiv: 2410.13132](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13132).
In this article, we compute the Gan-Gross-Prasad period integral of Klingen Eisenstein series over the unitary group \(\mathrm{U}(m+1,n+1)\) with a cuspidal automorphic form over \(\mathrm{U}(m+1,n)\), and show that it is related to certain special Rankin-Selberg \(L\)-values. We \(p\)-adically interpolate these Gan-Gross-Prasad period integrals as the Klingen Eisenstein series and the cuspidal automorphic form vary in Hida families. As a byproduct, we obtain a \(p\)-adic \(L\)-function of Rankin-Selberg type over \(\mathrm{U}(m,n) \times \mathrm{U}(m+1,n)\). The ultimate motivation is to show the \(p\)-primitive property of Klingen Eisenstein series over unitary groups, by computing such Gan-Gross-Prasad period integrals, and this article is a starting point of this project. The \(p\)-primitivity of Eisenstein series is an essential property in the automorphic method in Iwasawa theory.
