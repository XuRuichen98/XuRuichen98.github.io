Here are my notes on some courses and talks, as well as some expository articles. Please use them at your own risk.

## Notes for seminars

- **Universal Iwasawa theory**
  
  These are written notes when I am learning universal Iwasawa theory, i.e. the recent work of Fouquet-Wan titled "[*The Iwasawa Main Conjecture for universal families of modular motives*"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13726).
  
  - [Section 1](../files/universal/Talk01.pdf). Overview. (Sept 2024)
  
  - [Section 2](../files/universal/Talk02.pdf). Main conjectures in the language of fundamental lines. (Sept 2024)
  
  - [Section 3](../files/universal/Talk03.pdf). Control theorems. (Oct 2024)
  
  - [Section 4](../files/universal/Talk04.pdf). Beilinson-Kato zeta elements and their p-adic interpolation. (Oct 2024)

- **Solutions to exercises in R.Greenberg's Park City Note**
  
  These are solutions to selected exercises from Greenberg's note ["*Introduction to Iwasawa Theory for Elliptic Curves*"](http://www.ams.org/pcms/009).  They were prepared during a seminar with Haidong Li, Haijun Jia, and Luochen Zhao, who made substantial contributions to these solutions.
  
  [Chapter 1](../files/greenberg/Greenberg1.pdf), [Chapter 2](../files/greenberg/Greenberg2.pdf), [Chapter 3](../files/greenberg/Greenberg3.pdf), [Chapter 4](../files/greenberg/Greenberg4.pdf). (Updated: Dec 2023)

- **Automorphic methods in Iwasawa theory**
  
  These are written notes when I am learning the machinery of Eisenstein congruences over unitary groups. I introduced these contents in several seminars.
  
  - [Section 1](../files/eisenstein/Talk01.pdf). Motivations, setups, on unitary groups, etc. (Feb 2025)
  
  - [Section 1+](../files/eisenstein/Talk01p.pdf). More on unitary Shimura varieties. (May 2023)
  
  - [Section 2](../files/eisenstein/Talk02.pdf). Klingen Eisenstein series. (Mar 2025)
  
  - [Section 3](../files/eisenstein/Talk03.pdf). Klingen Eisenstein series and Siegel Eisenstein series. (May 2023)
  
  - [Section 4](../files/eisenstein/Talk04.pdf). Local computations: archimedean places. (May 2023)
  
  - [Section 5](../files/eisenstein/Talk05.pdf). Local computations: unramified places. (May 2023)
  
  - [Section 6](../files/eisenstein/Talk06.pdf). Local computations: ramified places. (May 2023)
  
  - [Section 7](../files/eisenstein/Talk07.pdf). Local computations: p-adic places. (May 2023)
  
  - [Section 8](../files/eisenstein/Talk08.pdf). Global computations (interpolations). (May 2023)
  
  We shall expand these notes to include more Galois-theoretic stuffs and TeXify them as a part of my thesis. For example:
  
  - [Section 9](../files/eisenstein/Talk09.pdf). Axiomatic Lattice construction. (Nov 2023)

- **Geometric modular forms**
  
  These are written notes for a study seminar on the geometric theory of modular forms and Hida theory.
  
  - [Section 1](../files/modularforms/Talk01.pdf). Algebro-geometric introduction to modular forms. (Mar 2023)
  
  - [Section 2](../files/modularforms/Talk02.pdf). Hida theory over GL_2. (Mar 2023)
  
  - [Section 3](../files/modularforms/Talk03.pdf). p-adic modular forms, more on Hida theory. (Mar 2023)

- **Automorphic forms and automorphic representations**
  
  These are written notes when I am learning the basic theory of automorphic forms and automorphic representations, using the book "GTM300" of Getz-Hahn.

## Expository articles

- [Euler systems](../files/writings/Note_on_Euler_System.pdf)  
  Coursework for the course *"Iwasawa Theory"* delivered by Professor Xin Wan at UCAS.  This is based on Chapters 1 to 3 of Rubin's book "*Euler systems*".
- [p-adic L-functions for Dirichlet characters](../files/writings/Note_on_p_adic_L_function_of_Dirichlet_characters.pdf)  
  Coursework for the course *"Iwasawa Theory"* delivered by Professor Xin Wan at UCAS.

## Notes for qualification exams

These are my notes (parts of which are in Chinese), which I prepared for the qualification exam in AMSS, CAS, in the Fall of 2022, along with a list of examples in TeX format.

- [Example-based exercises in algebra](../files/qualify/examples.pdf).

More to be continued.
