Here are my notes on some courses and talks, as well as some expository articles. Please use them at your own risk.

## Notes for seminars

- **Solutions to exercises in R.Greenberg's Park City Note**
  
  These are solutions to selected exercises from Greenberg's note ["Introduction to Iwasawa Theory for Elliptic Curves"](http://www.ams.org/pcms/009).  They were prepared during a seminar with Haidong Li, Haijun Jia, and Luochen Zhao, who made substantial contributions to these solutions.
  
  [Chapter 1](../files/greenberg/Greenberg1.pdf), [Chapter 2](../files/greenberg/Greenberg2.pdf), [Chapter 3](../files/greenberg/Greenberg3.pdf), [Chapter 4](../files/greenberg/Greenberg4.pdf). (Updated: December 2023)

- **Automorphic methods in Iwasawa theory**
  
  These are written notes when I am learning the machinery of Eisenstein congruences over unitary groups. I introduced these contents in several seminars.
  
  - [Section 1](rien). ...
  
  - [Section 2](rien). ...

- **Automorphic forms and automorphic representations**
  
  These are written notes when I am learning the basic theory of automorphic forms and automorphic representations, using the book "GTM300" of Getz-Hahn.

- **Geometric modular forms**
  
  These are written notes for a study seminar on the geometric theory of modular forms and Hida theory.

## Expository articles

- [Euler systems](../files/writings/Note_on_Euler_System.pdf)  
  Coursework for the course *"Iwasawa Theory"* delivered by Professor Xin Wan at UCAS.  
- [p-adic L-functions for Dirichlet characters](../files/writings/Note_on_p_adic_L_function_of_Dirichlet_characters.pdf)  
  Coursework for the course *"Iwasawa Theory"* delivered by Professor Xin Wan at UCAS.



## Notes for qualification exams

These are my notes (parts of which are in Chinese), which I prepared for the qualification exam in AMSS, CAS, in he Fall of 2022, along with a list of examples in TeX format.
